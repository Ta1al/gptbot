# Discord chatbot with GPT-3 Integration

_The README was partially written by the bot itself._

This program is a Discord bot that uses the [chatgpt library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) to integrate OpenAI GPT-3 capabilities into a Discord chat. With this bot, users can chat with the bot and receive responses generated by GPT-3 in real-time.

ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI and is intended for entertainment purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional advice or help, and its responses are not necessarily accurate or reliable. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- Chat with ChatGPT directly on your Discord server
- All your friends will see the conversation and be able to participate
- Natural, engaging conversations with the state-of-the-art large language model trained by OpenAI
- Easy to use – simply mention the bot in a channel and start chatting

## Installation

1. Create [new discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and invite it to your Discord server.
2. Install chatbot with NPM:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/leinstay/gptbot.git

# CD into directory
cd gptbot

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

3. Than adjust config.json providing [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications), [OpenAI Session](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api#session-tokens), [Application ID](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and list of channel and user IDs if you would like to restrict access to application.

```json
{
  "channelsWhitelist": [],
  "usersWhitelist": [
    "0000000000000000000",
    "0000000000000000000",
    "0000000000000000000"
  ],
  "OAISession": "YOUR-OPENAI-SESSION-HASH",
  "discordToken": "YOUR-DISCORD-TOKEN",
  "botID": "BOT-ID",
  "processingMessage": "Waiting for a response from OpenAI",
  "waitingMessage": "I am currently generating a response for another user, please wait",
  "accessMessage": "You do not have permission to communicate with OpenAI, contact the server administrator"
}
```

## Usage

I strongly recommend to use forever or pm2:

```bash
pm2 start index.js --name Bot --log bot.log
```

Оr you can run it directly without process managers:

```bash
node index.js
```

That's all there is to it! Try it out now and have fun chatting with ChatGPT on your Discord server.
